# README

This top-level document tells you where to look for what, in terms of documentation.
- ```overview.pdf/overview.org``` presents, at a high-level, what afspm is and how it works. This is a good starting point, to understand its purpose/goals and basics of the implementation.
- ```code_overview.md``` describes the package division of the code, i.e. where to find what.
- ```design_philosophy.md``` tries to explain the philosophy behind what afspm tries to do and (more importantly), what it explicitly tries *not* to do (and why).
- ```writing_a_microscope_translator.md``` explains what you need to do to implement your own SPM translator, to work with afspm.
- ```choosing_a_scheduler.md``` Goes over the two main schedulers and choosing between them.
